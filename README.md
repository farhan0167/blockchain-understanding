# Blockchain Understanding

Earlier in the June of 2022, while the cryptocurrency world went haywire, I became ever more curious about how blockchains work. While the youtube influencers were okay describing the blockchain as the thing of the future because it's immutable, I never quite understood the tech behind all of the mania. I have been a crypto skeptic since the hype began but for most parts because I think we are a long way from cryptocurrency replacing the dollar as a medium of exchange. But economics aside, the market conditions of June has sparked renewed interests in the area of blockchain so I decided to understand it by building one myself. I found this great [blog](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) that does a great job at walking you through building your own blockchain. I built one with the hope of getting inspired because while skepticism aside, I do believe the technology behind cryptos have the power to shape the next generation of everything tech. 

## Things I learned
1. What the blockchain is and how it works
2. How blocks are mined: aka implementing POW algorithm
3. Different cryptographic algorithms such as the SHA256 and SHA in general
4. Transactions
5. How blockchains determine which chain is valid aka a Consensus

## Future work
While I did a tutorial walkthrough, my curiosity is ever growing. Having a basic understanding of blockchain, I would like to explore the idea of Smart Contracts and more so how this tech has a potential of revolutionizing sectors where networks don't have trust built in them. Here is one [article](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/blockchain-insurance-disruption/?utm_source=CB+Insights+Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_general_sat_2022_07_23&utm_term=block-6&utm_content=research-public) that I find is a good read for what is possible with blockchain. 

I also plan to deploy this blockchain on Heroku with a UI implementation so that anybody could see the work. I hope to build more exciting things with the months to come.

## Find Code
The code is available in the [main](https://github.com/farhan0167/blockchain-understanding/tree/main/main) directory in blockchain .py.
